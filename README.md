### Hey, Iâ€™m a creator at heart!
**Thereâ€™s nothing I enjoy more than bringing ideas to life through code**. Whether itâ€™s crafting apps, designing websites, or building games, Iâ€™m always excited to create something new. Code is my favorite tool, and I love using it to make cool, fun, and useful things!

### Rapid Fire
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning: **ðŸ“š Learning Flutter best practices & testing with lot's of backend frameworks**
- âš¡ Fun fact: **ðŸŽ¢ I once debugged a silly issue for a whole day. Just kidding, it happens more than once! ðŸ¥¶**
